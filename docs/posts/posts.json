We hypothesized that these differences in behavior may have an adaptive value and stressed the need to verify this hypothesis.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed, because behavior and cognitive abilities are very sensitive to exposure to stressors and may drastically alter ecosystem functioning, such changes may have highly detrimental consequences in the wild. Hence, These preliminary results may be of great importance to help mitigate the effects of pollutants and improve conservation strategies in the wild.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, We had many ideas and perspectives about how stressors could affect behavior and, by extension, cognitive abilities in wild fish. Meanwhile, increasing our understanding of the relationships between cognitive ability and fitness in wild animals became a highly topical issue. Accordingly, with my PhD supervisor, Lisa Jacquin we gathered and wrote down our ideas in a perspective article about the effects of pollutants, and more broadly stressors, on fish cognition and behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe resulting article was then published in a special issue of Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution, focusing on the underlying mechanisms and constraints linking cognition and fitness in the wild (check out the special issue editorial article).\r\n\r\nThe feature\r\n\r\nRecently, I was pleased to be interviewed by Doug Johnson to talk about our article published in Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution.\r\nFollowing our talk, our paper has been covered in the Undark Magazine.\r\nThe full free article can be read on the Undark Magazine webpage\r\n\r\n See also my twitter thread about this feature : \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
