We hypothesized that these differences in behavior may\r\nhave an adaptive value and stressed the need to verify this hypothesis.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed, because behavior and cognitive abilities are very sensitive to\r\nexposure to stressors and may drastically alter ecosystem functioning,\r\nsuch changes may have highly detrimental consequences in the wild.\r\nHence, These preliminary results may be of great importance to help\r\nmitigate the effects of pollutants and improve conservation strategies\r\nin the wild.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, We had many ideas and perspectives about how stressors\r\ncould affect behavior and, by extension, cognitive abilities in wild\r\nfish. Meanwhile, recently, increasing our understanding of the\r\nrelationships between cognitive ability and fitness in wild animals\r\nbecame a highly topical issue. Accordingly, we gathered and wrote down\r\nour ideas in a\r\nperspective\r\narticle about the effects of pollutants, and more broadly stressors,\r\non fish cognition and behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe resulting article was then published in a special issue of\r\nFrontiers\r\nin Ecology and Evolution, focusing on the underlying mechanisms and\r\nconstraints linking cognition and fitness in the wild (check out\r\nthe\r\nspecial issue editorial article).\r\n\r\nThe feature\r\n\r\nRecently, I was pleased to be interviewed by\r\nDoug Johnson to talk\r\nabout\r\nour\r\narticle published in Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution. Following\r\nour talk, our paper has been covered in\r\nthe Undark Magazine. The full free\r\narticle can be read\r\non\r\nthe Undark Magazine webpage\r\n\r\n\r\nSee also my twitter thread about this feature\r\n:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Here you’ll find news about recently published articles,\r\nnew positions, and scientific and lab actualities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile introducing my website, I want to give credit where credit is due\r\nby citing several resources I used myself to build and customize my own\r\nwebsite using Distill for R\r\nMarkdown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a first look to the\r\nDistill for R Markdown\r\ntutorial webpage, one of the most useful resources I used is the\r\nThe Distillery, which\r\ncontains a nice\r\nshowcase that\r\ncan be explored to find some inspiration, but also a great\r\nTips &\r\ntricks section where you can find many ways to customize or add new\r\nfeatures to your own blog or website.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, the blogs of Ella Kaye,\r\nDanielle Navarro,\r\nJohn Paul Helveston and\r\nTom Mock contain much advice to\r\nimprove the appearance and add several functionalities to your Distill\r\nblog or website.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, it is possible to customize website’s style by using icons and\r\nanimals silhouette using internet libraries such as\r\nFont Awesome,\r\nAcademicons and\r\nPhylopic or by embedding\r\nAltmetric and\r\nDimension badges to\r\nyour publication record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLast updated on\r\n\r\n[1] \"2023-01-16 13:26:53 CET\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
