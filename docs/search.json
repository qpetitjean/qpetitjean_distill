More particularly, I joined\r\nVincent\r\nCALCAGNO’s lab to investigate the variability in activity and\r\nmovement among insect populations facing temperature changes. I was\r\ninvolved in the\r\nBIDIME\r\nproject (ANR) targeted at developing innovative biological control\r\nsolutions with insects, and transfer them to farmers and land managers.\r\nI collaborated with\r\nMichela ION\r\nSCOTTA, who reared 35 populations of small parasitic micro-wasps\r\n(genus Trichogramma) that were sampled in France along a\r\nlatitudinal gradient. Michela also performed experiments in which each\r\npopulation was subjected to steady decreases/increases in temperature\r\n(over 2 hours, see fig. 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Temperature ramps over which micro-wasps movements were\r\nrecorded and analyzed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe experiments were video-recorded, and my task was to use\r\nvideo-tracking solutions to quantify insect movements and their changes\r\nin response to temperature ramps. I analyzed the movements of the\r\n35 wasp populations to test for variability in thermal biology and\r\nactivity patterns. My aim was to uncover patterns of local adaptation\r\n(i.e., relationship between thermal resistance and the bioclimatic area\r\nof the origin of the populations) and test for adaptive trade-offs\r\nbetween resistance to cold and warm temperatures. This work\r\nalso inspired the development of an\r\n\r\npackage (MoveR) to easily process, filter, clean and analyze movement\r\ndata obtained from video-tracking.

Pascal LAFFAILLE.\r\n\r\nRead the story behind\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing my Ph.D. defense, I was still Intending to increase the\r\nintegration of multiple biological levels of organization in studying\r\nresponses to multiple stressors.  Since the literature\r\nhighlighting the close relationships between physiological and\r\nbehavioral responses and gut microbiota composition was flourishing, my\r\nsupervisors (Lisa\r\nJACQUIN,\r\nSéverine\r\nJEAN and\r\nPascal\r\nLAFFAILLE) and I started a collaboration with\r\nJoël WHITE to investigate\r\nhow multiples stressors may affect gut microbiota composition among\r\nseveral populations of wild fish.  Fortunately, during my\r\nPh.D., we collected the gut of all the fish involved in laboratory and\r\nreciprocal transplant experiments testing for the combined effect of\r\ntrace metal contamination and immune challenge. This provided a fair\r\namount of samples to investigate the intraspecific variability of gut\r\nmicrobiota composition in wild fish populations exposed to\r\nenvironmentally relevant stressors. Also, it allowed uncovering\r\npotential links between fish physiological and/or behavioral responses\r\nalready measured during my Ph.D. and gut microbiota composition.\r\n While the COVID-19 pandemic knocked at the world’s door, we\r\nwere coerced to delay laboratory analyses (DNA extractions – PCR – NGS).\r\nFortunately, I just had enough time to finish lab’ and bioinformatic\r\nanalyses before leaving this position for the next one. Currently,\r\nthanks to Margarita Granada (a Second-year master’s student), final\r\nstatistical analyses and writing are on the way!  Stay tuned\r\nfor further news to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  October 2016 - December 2019 | Ph.D candidate |\r\nPaul Sabatier University—UPS,\r\nToulouse, FR\r\n\r\n\r\nTitle: «Variability of responses among freshwater fish\r\npopulations exposed to multiple stressors».Supervisor(s):\r\nDr. Lisa JACQUIN, Dr. Séverine JEAN & Pr. Pascal\r\nLAFFAILLE.\r\n\r\nRead the story behind\r\n\r\n\r\nFreshly Graduated from Bourgogne-Franche-Comté University with a\r\nmaster’s in environmental sciences/ecotoxicology, I was lucky enough to\r\nwork with very supportive people on stimulating and interdisciplinary\r\nprojects (see my previous experiences below). Briefly, I was working on\r\ntransfer, fate, and effects of contaminants on laboratory-raised\r\norganisms when new exciting questions arose. For example, could the\r\noutcomes of contaminants exposure differ according to the origin of the\r\npopulations? Focusing on this question would imply working with\r\nwild populations. Still, in the wild, organisms are not only exposed to\r\ncontaminants but rather to a combination of stressful conditions such as\r\ntemperature changes or pathogens. This brings me to drill into\r\nevolutionary ecology and intraspecific variability to better understand\r\nhow multiple stressors interact and whether the outcome of stressors\r\nexposure may differ among populations. Accordingly, I started\r\na Ph.D. program with\r\nLisa JACQUIN,\r\nSéverine\r\nJEAN and\r\nPascal\r\nLAFFAILLE to investigate the intraspecific variability of responses\r\nto multiple stressors among wild fish populations (Gobio\r\noccitaniae) and across levels of biological organization.\r\nTo tackle these aims, I used complementary approaches (see\r\nfig. 2 below) such as the analysis of large\r\ndatasets collated in the field to uncover potential relationships\r\nbetween stressors exposure and fish health\r\n(Petitjean\r\net al., 2020). But also, full factorial design conducted in the lab\r\nto identify causal link between stressors exposure and plastic responses\r\nof fish from several populuations\r\n(Petitjean\r\net al., 2020;\r\n\r\nPetitjean et al., 2021). Finally, I performed a reciprocal\r\ntransplant experiment in the field to unveil potential pattern of local\r\nadaptation to stressors exposure (Petitjean et al., under review).\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Summary of the research questions investigated\r\nduring my Ph.D. and the complementary approaches used to tackle them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBriefly, we found that combinations of stressors resulted in different\r\noutcomes than exposure to single stressors. Still, interactions were\r\nantagonistic, synergistic, or additive depending on the traits and level\r\nof biological organization. Accordingly, among the numerous traits\r\nmeasured, behavior appeared to be the most sensitive to stressors\r\nexposure. Also, populations’ responses to stressors differed according\r\nto their origin. By using reciprocal transplant approaches, we found\r\nthat some populations were more resistant to stream contamination with\r\nno apparent costs (no trade-off). the results of my Ph.D suggest that we\r\nneed to rely on integrative and interdisciplinary approaches to improve\r\nour knowledge of the effect of multiple stressors and, more generally,\r\nglobal changes on populations’ adaptive potential and vulnerability (see\r\nfig. 3).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Summary of the research questions investigated during\r\nduring my Ph.D. and the complementary approaches used to tackle them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the\r\nPublication\r\nsection of this website.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  February 2016 - July 2016 | M.Sc. candidate |\r\nBourgogne-Franche-Comté\r\nUniversity—UBFC, Besançon, FR\r\n\r\n\r\nTitle: «Impacts of metallurgical wastes on soil\r\ncontamination: transfer and fate of trace metal elements».Supervisor(s): Dr. Annette DE VAUFLEURY & Dr. Frédéric\r\nGIMBERT.\r\n\r\nRead the story behind\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring my second year of my master’s, I was still motivated to\r\nstrengthen our knowledge about the effects of contaminants from\r\ndifferent sources on animals. Also, although short, my previous research\r\nexperience aroused my curiosity and the need to broaden my scope by\r\ninteracting with researchers embracing various disciplines. At that\r\ntime,\r\n\r\nFrédéric GIMBERT and\r\n\r\nAnnette DE VAUFLEURY gave me the opportunity to work on an\r\ninterdisciplinary study involving archeology, mineralogy, environmental\r\nchemistry, and ecotoxicology.  Indeed mining and metallurgical\r\nactivities are the most ancient sources of anthropogenic contamination\r\nin the environment. While the evidence of this ancient contamination is\r\nscarce, archeological surveys in eastern France unveiled several areas\r\n(i.e., districts) which have been significant places of mining and\r\nmetallurgical activities in the medieval era (between the 8th and the\r\n12th centuries). Currently, metallurgical wastes named slags are still\r\npresent in numerous district soils and may represent a significant\r\nsource of soil contamination.  Here we aimed to characterize\r\nthe mineralogical composition of slags deposited one thousand years ago\r\nand to uncover whether it could still be a significant source of soil\r\ncontamination that could transfer to organisms and have harmful effects.\r\n To tackle these aims, we sampled slags and soil cores along\r\ntransects starting from the center of the slag heap. We then used\r\nscanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS)\r\nmapping and x-ray diffraction to analyze slags and soil mineralogical\r\ncomposition. We also conducted chemical extraction and ecotoxicity\r\nbioassays using land snail (Cantareus aspersus) on soil samples\r\nto assess contaminant transfers in plants and biota and infer possible\r\nharmful effects.  Briefly, We found that slags that remain in\r\nthe soil still release a significant amount of manganese (Mn), which is\r\nconsistent with their mineralogical composition. We also uncovered that\r\na large proportion of the Mn contamination might be available for\r\ntransfers in plants and animals, especially land snails. However, we did\r\nnot find any evidence of toxicity caused by soils contamination on\r\nsnails (see fig. 4). \r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Summary of the results discussed in\r\nPetitjean\r\net al., 2021 Origin, fate and ecotoxicity of manganese from legacy\r\nmetallurgical wastes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis study and previous\r\nwork by Anne-Lise Mariet (former Ph.D. student) in the Vosges\r\nMountains paved the way to further projects/studies investigating\r\nthe spatial occurrence, transfers, fate, and effects of metallic\r\npalaeo-pollution in eastern France (e.g.,\r\nSIDEROS\r\nand\r\nALTERICS).\r\nFor more information, see the\r\nPublication\r\nsection of this website.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  February 2015 - May 2015 | M.Sc. candidate |\r\nBourgogne-Franche-Comté\r\nUniversity—UBFC, Besançon, FR\r\n\r\n\r\nTitle: «Trace metal availability and transfers assessment in\r\na leachates pond collector from a municipal solid waste landfill using\r\nChironomus riparius».Supervisor(s): Dr. Frédéric GIMBERT\r\n& Pr. Aleya LOTFI.\r\n\r\nRead the story behind\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile aware of the need to mitigate the increasing degradation of the\r\nenvironment caused by anthropogenic activities, I was motivated to\r\nstrengthen our knowledge about the effects of contaminants on animals.\r\nIn this context, I had the opportunity to conduct an internship with\r\n\r\nFrédéric GIMBERT and\r\nLotfi\r\nALEYA to investigate the bioavailability of trace metal elements in\r\na landfill leachate collection pond. Indeed, until 2002\r\nhousehold waste disposal was authorized in France, resulting in\r\ncontamination of the surrounding environment, primarily through\r\ncontaminants leaching. To reduce environmental contamination entailed by\r\nthis mode of waste storage, the Etueffont landfill (i.e., study site)\r\nset up a lagoon ponds system collecting landfill leachates.\r\nHere, we aimed to better understand whether leachates released in the\r\nponds may induce the accumulation of trace metal elements in biota\r\n(i.e., bioaccumulation kinetics) and how water and sediment may\r\ncontribute to the observed bioaccumulation’ patterns. To\r\ntackle these aims, we used an active biomonitoring approach through\r\ncaging laboratory-raised midges larvae (Chironomus riparius) in\r\nthe first landfill leachate collection pond. More particularly, we used\r\ntwo types of cages to either expose the larvae to water only or water\r\nand sediment for a five days maximum duration (see\r\nfig. 5).\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Type of cages used for active biomonitoring, the cage\r\non the left (WS) allows exposing the midges to water and sediment. In\r\ncontrast, the cage on the right (W) allows exposing the midges to water\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBack in the laboratory, we performed subcellular fractionation of the\r\nmidges to measure trace metal bioaccumulation in the cytosolic (i.e.,\r\nsensitive fraction) and insoluble fractions. We then modeled the\r\nbioaccumulation kinetic for each contaminant and fraction. This helped\r\nto discuss the primary source of contaminant transfers (i.e., water\r\nand/or sediment), contaminant bioavailability, and the potential threat\r\nentailed by landfill leachates on biota.
