Briefly, this project aimed to develop innovation in biological pest control solutions and transfer it to farmers and land managers. More particularly, I joined Vincent Calcagno’s lab to investigate the variability of movements of insect groups to temperature among 35 populations sampled along a latitude gradient. Here I mainly collaborated with Michela Ion Scotta who reared the populations of small parasitoïd fly named Trichogramma. Michela has also camera-recorded the insect groups during steady decreases/increases in temperature (see fig. 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Temperature ramps over which flies’ movements were recorded and analyzed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce the videos were recorded, I used video-tracking solutions to retrieve flies’ movements over the temperature ramps for a relatively long time (1.5 hours, see Fig. 1). I then analyzed the movements of the 35 flies populations to test for the variability in thermal biology and movements. My aim here was to uncover potential patterns of local adaptation (i.e., relationship between resistance and the bioclimatic area of the origin of the populations) and test for the existence of adaptive trade-offs between resistance to cold and warm temperatures. Besides this work also inspired the development of an  package (MoveR) to easily filter, clean and analyze movement data (Stay tuned for upcoming release).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n For more insight about what I did within the project check the video below \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   January 2020 - December 2021 | Postdoctoral researcher | National Polytechnic Institute—INP, Toulouse, FR\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n\r\n   October 2016 - December 2019 | Ph.D candidate | Paul Sabatier University—UPS, Toulouse, FR\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n\r\n   February 2016 - July 2016 | M.Sc. candidate | Bourgogne-Franche-Comté University—UBFC, Besançon, FR\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n\r\n   February 2015 - May 2015 | M.Sc. candidate | Bourgogne-Franche-Comté University—UBFC, Besançon, FR\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n\r\nTeaching & supervising\r\n\r\n   National Polytechnic Institute—INP | Electrofishing/inventory of fish species (≈16h)    Paul Sabatier University—UPS | Multivariate data analysis (≈50h)    Students internship co-supervision | 8 B.Sc and 5 M.Sc students\r\n\r\nGrants\r\n\r\n   2019 | Travel grant for the SETAC Europe 29th meeting (≈430€)\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrant programme supported by the SETAC Europe reinvestment fund and Syngenta to help student members participating to the SETAC Europe 29th meeting meeting (Up to maximum 250€, Travel costs only, visa and accommodation are not included).\r\n\r\n\r\n   2016 | Ph.D grant from French research and education ministry (≈60k€)\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\n3 years stipend allowed by the French research and education ministry to study the variability of responses among freshwater fish populations (Gobio occitaniae) exposed to multiple stressors at the Paul Sabatier University—UPS.\r\n\r\n\r\n   2015 | Leonard Da Vinci international mobility grant (≈2.5k€)\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nEuropean grant supporting individual mobility projects to acquire training and professional experience within Europe. \r\n\r\nI conducted a 3.5 month internship (June 2014 to mid-september 2014) in the Plant Ecology Research Unit (PERU) of the National University of Ireland Galway (NUIG) under the supervision of the Pr. Micheline Sheehy Skeffington. I have mainly assisted the Pr. Sheehy Skeffington and it’s team members to conduct plants inventories in heatland and hay meadows.  I have also worked to update the collection of the university of Galway’ herbarium. \r\n\r\nInternship subjects:  «Restoring plant species richness and forage quality to hay meadows on the River Shannon, Ireland.»  «Ecology and conservation of Arctostaphylos heath in the Burren, Western Ireland.»\r\n\r\nCongress & Professional memberships\r\nCongress organization\r\n\r\n   14th meeting Ecology and Behaviour (E&B) 2019\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n\r\nThe « Ecology and Behaviour » conferences are organized by and for young researchers. These events are an ideal opportunity for master, Ph.D. students, and postdocs to share their works with other researchers in ecology, evolutionary biology, and behavioral ecology. \r\n\r\nAs Co-organizer, chairman (Ecotoxicology & Ecophysiology session), and financial manager (Fundraising: 20k€) of the 14th meeting Ecology and Behaviour (E&B) 2019, I was really proud of this great achievement which gathered more than 160 attendees and 14 keynote speakers around 56 platform presentations and 38 posters. \r\n\r\n\r\nMembership\r\n\r\n   British Ecological Society (BES)    Société Française d’Écologie et d’Évolution (SFE²)    Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC)    Society for open, reliable and transparent ecology and evolutionary biology (SORTEE)    Statistical ecology research network (EcoStat)\r\n\r\nPeer reviews\r\n\r\n   Environmental Science and Pollution Research (n=4)   Critical Reviews in Environmental Sciences and Technology (n=2)   Journal of Experimental Zoology Part A: Ecological Genetics and Physiology (n=1)   Science of The Total Environment (n=1)   Ecology Letters (n=1)\r\n\r\nHobbies\r\n\r\n   Hiking/fishing: Fauna and flora watching and photography    Sports: Basket ball, volley-ball   Travel: Cultural and naturalist trip (Western Europe, China, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Nicaragua)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
