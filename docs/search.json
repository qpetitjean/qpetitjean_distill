(DNA extractions – PCR) and bioinformatics analyses, my growing interest in the intraspecific variability of responses to global changes guided me to join the Institut Sophia Agrobiotech—ISA. Here I was involved in the BIDIME project aiming to develop innovation in biological pest control solutions and transfer it to farmers and land managers. More particularly, I joined Vincent CALCAGNO’s lab to investigate the movement variability among insect populations facing temperature changes. Here I mainly collaborated with Michela ION SCOTTA, who reared the 35 populations of small parasitic micro-wasps (i.e., Trichogramma) that have been sampled along a latitude gradient. Michela has also video-recorded the insect groups during steady decreases/increases in temperature (2 hours, see fig. 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Temperature ramps over which flies’ movements were recorded and analyzed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce the videos were recorded, I used video-tracking solutions to retrieve flies’ movements over the temperature ramps. I then analyzed the movements of the 35 flies populations to test for the variability in thermal biology and movements. My aim here was to uncover potential patterns of local adaptation (i.e., relationship between resistance and the bioclimatic area of the origin of the populations) and test for the existence of adaptive trade-offs between resistance to cold and warm temperatures. Besides this work also inspired the development of an  package (MoveR) to easily filter, clean and analyze movement data.  Stay tuned for upcoming release.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n For more insight about what I did within the project check the video below \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   January 2020 - December 2021 | Postdoctoral researcher | National Polytechnic Institute—INP, Toulouse, FR\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing my Ph.D. defense, I was still Intending to increase the integration of multiple biological levels of organization in studying responses to multiple stressors.  Since the literature highlighting the close relationships between physiological and behavioral responses and gut microbiota composition was flourishing, my supervisors (Lisa JACQUIN, Séverine JEAN and Pascal LAFFAILLE) and I started a collaboration with Joël WHITE to investigate how multiples stressors may affect gut microbiota composition among several populations of wild fish.  Fortunately, during my Ph.D., we collected the gut of all the fish involved in laboratory and reciprocal transplant experiments testing for the combined effect of trace metal contamination and immune challenge. This provided a fair amount of samples to investigate the intraspecific variability of gut microbiota composition in wild fish populations exposed to environmentally relevant stressors. Also, it allowed uncovering potential links between fish physiological and/or behavioral responses already measured during my Ph.D. and gut microbiota composition.  While the COVID-19 pandemic knocked at the world’s door, we were coerced to delay laboratory analyses (DNA extractions – PCR – NGS). Fortunately, I just had enough time to finish lab’ and bioinformatic analyses before leaving this position for the next one. Currently, thanks to Margarita Granada (a Second-year master’s student), final statistical analyses and writing are on the way!  Stay tuned for further news to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   October 2016 - December 2019 | Ph.D candidate | Paul Sabatier University—UPS, Toulouse, FR\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n\r\n\r\nFreshly Graduated from Bourgogne-Franche-Comté University with a master’s in environmental sciences/ecotoxicology, I was lucky enough to work with very supportive people on stimulating and interdisciplinary projects (see my previous experiences below). Briefly, I was working on transfer, fate, and effects of contaminants on laboratory-raised organisms when new exciting questions arose. For example, could the outcomes of contaminants exposure differ according to the origin of the populations? Focusing on this question would imply working with wild populations. Still, in the wild, organisms are not only exposed to contaminants but rather to a combination of stressful conditions such as temperature changes or pathogens. This brings me to drill into evolutionary ecology and intraspecific variability to better understand how multiple stressors interact and whether the outcome of stressors exposure may differ among populations. Accordingly, I started a Ph.D. program with Lisa JACQUIN, Séverine JEAN and Pascal LAFFAILLE to investigate the intraspecific variability of responses to multiple stressors among wild fish populations (Gobio occitaniae) and across levels of biological organization (see the Publication section of this website to retrieve the manuscript or peer-reviewed articles). More information to come soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   February 2016 - July 2016 | M.Sc. candidate | Bourgogne-Franche-Comté University—UBFC, Besançon, FR\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring my second year of my master’s, I was still motivated to strengthen our knowledge about the effects of contaminants from different sources on animals. Also, although short, my previous research experience aroused my curiosity and the need to broaden my scope by interacting with researchers embracing various disciplines. At that time,  Frédéric GIMBERT and  Annette DE VAUFLEURY gave me the opportunity to work on an interdisciplinary study involving archeology, mineralogy, environmental chemistry, and ecotoxicology.  Indeed mining and metallurgical activities are the most ancient sources of anthropogenic contamination in the environment. While the evidence of this ancient contamination is scarce, archeological surveys in eastern France unveiled several areas (i.e., districts) which have been significant places of mining and metallurgical activities in the medieval era (between the 8th and the 12th centuries). Currently, metallurgical wastes named slags are still present in numerous district soils and may represent a significant source of soil contamination.  Here we aimed to characterize the mineralogical composition of slags deposited one thousand years ago and to uncover whether it could still be a significant source of soil contamination that could transfer to organisms and have harmful effects.  To tackle these aims, we sampled slags and soil cores along transects starting from the center of the slag heap. We then used scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) mapping and x-ray diffraction to analyze slags and soil mineralogical composition. We also conducted chemical extraction and ecotoxicity bioassays using land snail (Cantareus aspersus) on soil samples to assess contaminant transfers in plants and biota and infer possible harmful effects.  Briefly, We found that slags that remain in the soil still release a significant amount of manganese (Mn), which is consistent with their mineralogical composition. We also uncovered that a large proportion of the Mn contamination might be available for transfers in plants and animals, especially land snails. However, we did not find any evidence of toxicity caused by soils contamination on snails (see fig. 2). \r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Summary of the results discussed in Petitjean et al., 2021 Origin, fate and ecotoxicity of manganese from legacy metallurgical wastes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis study and previous work by Anne-Lise Mariet (former Ph.D. student) in the Vosges Mountains paved the way to further projects/studies investigating the spatial occurrence, transfers, fate, and effects of metallic palaeo-pollution in eastern France (e.g., SIDEROS and ALTERICS). For more information, see the Publication section of this website.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   February 2015 - May 2015 | M.Sc. candidate | Bourgogne-Franche-Comté University—UBFC, Besançon, FR\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile aware of the need to mitigate the increasing degradation of the environment caused by anthropogenic activities, I was motivated to strengthen our knowledge about the effects of contaminants on animals. In this context, I had the opportunity to conduct an internship with  Frédéric GIMBERT and Lotfi ALEYA to investigate the bioavailability of trace metal elements in a landfill leachate collection pond. Indeed, until 2002 household waste disposal was authorized in France, resulting in contamination of the surrounding environment, primarily through contaminants leaching. To reduce environmental contamination entailed by this mode of waste storage, the Etueffont landfill (i.e., study site) set up a lagoon ponds system collecting landfill leachates. Here, we aimed to better understand whether leachates released in the ponds may induce the accumulation of trace metal elements in biota (i.e., bioaccumulation kinetics) and how water and sediment may contribute to the observed bioaccumulation’ patterns. To tackle these aims, we used an active biomonitoring approach through caging laboratory-raised midges larvae (Chironomus riparius) in the first landfill leachate collection pond. More particularly, we used two types of cages to either expose the larvae to water only or water and sediment for a five days maximum duration (see fig. 3).\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Type of cages used for active biomonitoring, the cage on the left (WS) allows exposing the midges to water and sediment. In contrast, the cage on the right (W) allows exposing the midges to water only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBack in the laboratory, we performed subcellular fractionation of the midges to measure trace metal bioaccumulation in the cytosolic (i.e., sensitive fraction) and insoluble fractions. We then modeled the bioaccumulation kinetic for each contaminant and fraction. This helped to discuss the primary source of contaminant transfers (i.e., water and/or sediment), contaminant bioavailability, and the potential threat entailed by landfill leachates on biota.

The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\r\n Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are\r\n intended for use by those authorized to give the public\r\n permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\r\n copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\r\n irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\r\n and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\r\n Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\r\n applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\r\n material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any\r\n material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-\r\n licensed material, or material used under an exception or\r\n limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:\r\nwiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\r\n\r\n Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\r\n licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\r\n licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\r\n the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\r\n example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\r\n copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\r\n licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\r\n other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\r\n the licensed material may still be restricted for other\r\n reasons, including because others have copyright or other\r\n rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\r\n such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\r\n Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\r\n respect those requests where reasonable.

To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\r\nSection 1 – Definitions.\r\nAdapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.\r\nAdapter’s License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\nBY-NC-SA Compatible License means a license listed at creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.\r\nCopyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\r\nEffective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.\r\nExceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\r\nLicense Elements means the license attributes listed in the name of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License are Attribution, NonCommercial, and ShareAlike.\r\nLicensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.\r\nLicensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\r\nLicensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.\r\nNonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the exchange.\r\nShare means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.\r\nSui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\r\nYou means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\r\nSection 2 – Scope.\r\nLicense grant.\r\nSubject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\r\nreproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and\r\nproduce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only.\r\n\r\nExceptions and Limitations.

The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\r\nMedia and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\r\nnever produces Adapted Material.\r\n\r\nDownstream recipients.\r\nOffer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\nAdditional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply.\r\nNo downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\r\n\r\nNo endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\r\n\r\nOther rights.\r\nMoral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\r\nPatent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\r\nTo the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial purposes.\r\n\r\nSection 3 – License Conditions.\r\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\r\nAttribution.\r\nIf You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\r\nretain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\r\nidentification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\r\na copyright notice;\r\na notice that refers to this Public License;\r\na notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\r\na URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\r\n\r\nindicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\r\nindicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\r\n\r\nYou may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\r\nIf requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\r\n\r\nShareAlike.\r\nIn addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\r\nThe Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License.\r\nYou must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter’s License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.\r\nYou may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter’s License You apply.\r\n\r\nSection 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\r\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\r\nfor the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only;\r\nif You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\r\nYou must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\r\nSection 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\r\nUNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\nTO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\nThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\r\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\r\nThis Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\r\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\r\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\r\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\r\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\r\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\r\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\r\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\r\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\r\nNo term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\r\nNothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\r\n=======================================================================\r\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.
