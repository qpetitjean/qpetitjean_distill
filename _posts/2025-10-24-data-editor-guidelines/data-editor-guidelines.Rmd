# The guidelines 
<p class="plain-text">
These guidelines offer the first standardized framework for <strong>Data and Code Quality Control</strong> led by SORTEE members and data editors across journals in ecology and evolution. The article introduces what data editors do, why quality control matters and provides a transparent, step-by-step process for checking archived data and code alongside manuscripts. Aimed at journal editors, reviewers, and authors, it outlines expected benefits and costs and gives practical advice for adoption. As a complement to peer review, it helps ensure that shared data and code adhere to the FAIR principles—<em>Findable · Accessible · Interoperable · Reusable</em>—at publication.

# SORTEE in a nutshell
<p class="plain-text">
SORTEE—the <em>Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</em>—is an international, volunteer-driven community working to improve research reliability and transparency through cultural and institutional change. Activities include producing open-science resources (e.g., the above-mentioned guidelines), hosting webinars and annual unconferences/hackathons, and running the field-specific preprint server <em>EcoEvoRxiv</em>.
